# knietty implementation handoff

This directory is the ordered execution plan for the next knietty development
cycle. Read [TTY_PROGRESS.md](../../TTY_PROGRESS.md) first: it is the authority
for what was actually built, flashed, and observed. These playbooks describe
future work and must never be treated as test results.

Milestones 01–05 are complete as of the Rust-host cutover. The capture-driven
terminal/Codex parser slice and explicit session-close follow-up are physically
validated. The next bounded product slice is safe in-session CLI display
control through the active Rust bridge, followed by the remaining compatibility
work and Milestone 06 TLS/pairing. Display Milestone 07 may proceed independently
without modifying the frozen baseline files.

## Locked decisions

- Wi-Fi is the primary transport for the tested China-locked X4. Do not use
  `esptool`, PlatformIO upload, the Unlocker, or alter partitions, bootloader,
  secure boot, or eFuses.
- Safe 20 MHz remains the immutable display control. Adaptive 40 MHz remains an
  explicitly experimental comparison; adaptive 20 MHz is not a release target.
- Terminus 8 x 16 and 80 x 24 remain the default geometry.
- Protocol v3 is one bounded framed stream on the existing discovery/TCP
  service. It supports terminal and diagnostics modes, preserves v1/v2 fallback,
  and is the protocol later wrapped by TLS.
- Diagnostics requires physical approval. It exposes bounded named tests, never
  arbitrary SSD1677 commands, voltages, OTP writes, or overclock values.
- `PRESENTED` means BUSY fell. `READY` means all post-waveform baseline and
  power work completed. Both are required because their gap is a primary target.
- Rust is the sole host implementation; its v3 fixture and diagnostics schema
  remain frozen compatibility contracts.
- BLE keyboard work is backlog, not part of this sequence.

## Productive order

| Milestone | Outcome | Depends on | Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [01](01-safe-state.md) | Terminal safely owns and restores display settings | Current checkpoint | All hardware experiments |
| [02](02-protocol-v3.md) | Tested framed v3 with v1/v2 compatibility | 01 | Diagnostics and Rust |
| [03](03-diagnostics-mode.md) | Approved host-driven tests and JSONL telemetry | 02 | Comparable measurements |
| [04](04-baseline-campaign.md) | Reproducible safe/adaptive baseline dataset | 03 | Driver optimization claims |
| [05](05-rust-host.md) | Rust host owns foreground bridge and diagnostics | 04 | Production TLS client |
| [06](06-tls-pairing.md) | Authenticated encrypted transport | 05 | Untrusted-LAN use |
| [07](07-mode2-ping-pong.md) | Volatile RAM-ping-pong A/B result | 04 | Baseline-copy decision |
| [08](08-async-pipeline.md) | Latest-frame-wins tail-chained refresh pipeline | 07 | Final latency tuning |
| [09](09-waveform-quality.md) | Measured legibility/speed waveform choice | 08 | Release display profile |
| [10](10-gate-viewport.md) | Independent 800 x 300 feasibility result | 09 | Optional speed viewport |
| [11](11-release-validation.md) | Linux/macOS/device evidence and release docs | 06, 09 | Release candidate |

Milestone 06 and 07 can proceed independently. Keep their commits isolated.
Milestone 08 must consume the measured result from 07; do not assume Mode 2
works.

The parser/TUI improvements discussed during Milestone 05 are saved in
[`TERMINAL_COMPATIBILITY.md`](TERMINAL_COMPATIBILITY.md) and are explicitly
scheduled after Rust host parity. They are not a reason to expand the current
Rust slice into firmware work.

## Rules for every milestone

1. Start from a clean, identified commit and record the parent in
   `TTY_PROGRESS.md`. Preserve unrelated user changes.
2. Inspect the source anchors in the milestone before editing. Re-check line
   numbers because this branch is evolving.
3. Make the smallest change that satisfies that milestone. Avoid CrossPoint
   refactors and keep driver experiments behind knietty/X4 feature gates.
4. Do not add repeated heap allocation to terminal, network, render, or display
   loops. Use fixed-size storage where possible; justify and null-check every
   allocation against the ESP32-C3 RAM ceiling.
5. Run the listed automated checks. Use `./bin/clang-format-fix -g`; do not call
   `clang-format` directly.
6. Hardware observations must identify artifact SHA-256, embedded commit,
   profile, settings, device, workload, and host OS. Never infer Linux parity
   from macOS or physical behavior from a successful build.
7. On a failed hardware gate, restore the known-good image through the normal
   CrossPoint OTA/SD routes and document the failure. Do not stack another
   experiment on top.
8. Update `TTY_PROGRESS.md`, commit the working checkpoint, and record its hash
   before advancing.

## Common verification commands

Run only the relevant firmware profiles for a milestone; safe is mandatory
before any experimental image.

```sh
cd /Users/rodrigomtorres/git/knietty/crosspoint-reader

env PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH" ./bin/clang-format-fix -g

./host-rs/scripts/check.sh

native_test_dir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/knietty-tests.XXXXXX)
cmake -S test -B "$native_test_dir" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-isystem /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX26.5.sdk/usr/include/c++/v1'
cmake --build "$native_test_dir" -j4
ctest --test-dir "$native_test_dir" --output-on-failure

$HOME/.platformio/penv/bin/pio run -e knietty_safe
```

The explicit macOS SDK include is a recorded workaround, not a portable project
requirement. Linux agents should use their normal CMake toolchain and record it.

## Artifact and result layout

Firmware artifacts stay outside `.pio` under the workspace root, with the
commit/profile in the filename and a recorded SHA-256. Diagnostic outputs use:

```text
results/
  YYYY-MM-DD-device-profile-suite-run.jsonl
  YYYY-MM-DD-device-profile-suite-notes.md
```

Do not commit large captures by default. Commit the schema, small representative
fixtures, summaries, and the path/checksum of externally retained raw data.
